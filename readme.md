A Version of the classic hit Hunt the Wumpus

-INSTRUCTIONS- Welcome to "Hunt the Wumpus" – the game where YOU are the hero, the caves are confusing, and the Wumpus really needs a breath mint.

You, a brave but questionably prepared adventurer, are stuck in a dark, twisty cave made of 20 rooms connected by tunnels. Somewhere in this cave is the WUMPUS – a grumpy, meat-eating creature with zero chill and no regard for personal space.

The Wumpus: Sleeps until disturbed, then gets cranky and eats people. Do NOT poke the Wumpus.

Bottomless Pits: Like my bank account. No more explanation needed...

Super Bats: These over-caffeinated maniacs grab you and drop you off in random rooms. Not cool man.

-HOW TO PLAY-

You start in a room. Every turn, you can:
Move to a connected room.
Shoot an arrow into one or more connected rooms.
Listen carefully: you might SMELL the Wumpus, FEEL a breeze from a pit, or HEAR the bats giggling.
Your goal? Turn the Wumpus into Wumpus stew before HE turns YOU into a chew toy.
-HOW TO DIE-

Fall into a pit.
Get kidnapped by bats and dropped into the Wumpus's yoga studio.
Wake up the Wumpus by shooting like a maniac.
